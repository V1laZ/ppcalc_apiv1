# ppcalc_apiv1
Very basic naive CLI app that calculates gained and needed pp based on user input. Did this to learn some basic Rust stuff.

## How to use
- When you first run the app it will ask you to put your osu! API key
- You can find it in your profile settings [page](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/account/edit#legacy-api)

## How to compile
- Download and install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Open the app directory and run
```
cargo build
```
- You should see the compiled *.exe* file in `target\debug`
